Outstanding issues (list in reverse date order)

5 May 2021 (BM)
- implemented loss function for F(nu,z) = 0 format
- implemented BCs loss
- added data_handler.model_params object property to store output structure from model (ss['m'])
- need to work on data generator for multiple runs, caching data, tf code for tf dataset management

1 May 2021 (YQ)
- completed ssc equations, debugged as much as I can 

- we can use the output structure from the model (i.e. ss['m']) to initialise the model parameter structure for get_physics. But this requires a bit of reformatting which can be done with reformat_params(m) in constitutive.py

- how to implement boundary conditions?

- write out physics-informed loss function so YQ can improve ssc code organisation. Issue with dp/dz appearing in mbe in a non-linear way.
