For sharing code with YQ

1) Make a python virtualenv
   `python3 -m venv venv`

2) Enter the virtualenv
   `source venv/bin/activate`

3) Install matlab engine while inside the venv (instructions by Ying Qi Wong)

   - Navigate to folder of Matlab app where python engine is located. 
     On Mac, e.g.

	cd /Applications/MATLAB_R2021a.app/extern/engines/python

   - Try to set up the python engine by running
        
        python setup.py install

     This probably won't work because you don't have permissions to write  
     in this directory. Need to change permissions of the directory.
     First go to upper level, change permissions of python directory to 
     allow group to write changes. Then try to install again

	cd .. 
	sudo chmod 775 python
	cd python
	python setup.py install

3) Upgrade pip
  `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel`

4) Install dependencies via pip
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5) Add your new environment as a kernel
   `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=neural_conduit`

6) Start jupyter lab
   `jupyter lab`

7) Open a notebook

8) Enable our new kernel. Go to Kernel > Change Kernel... and select 
   "neural_conduit"

9) Run the code!
